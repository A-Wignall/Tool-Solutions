# Arm Fast Models quick start

[Arm Fast Models](https://developer.arm.com/products/system-design/fast-models) are fast, flexible programmer&#39;s view models of Arm IP. Fast Models are used to build virtual prototypes for software development which are useful during all phases of a project. System models can start very small and grow into comprehensive models of hardware. Fast Models are also a great way to learn the details of software development for the Arm architecture.

Ease of use and flexibility make Fast Models an important tool for software developers. Virtual prototype creators construct system models and provide them to software developers to enable early software development.

This quick start covers how to run an example system with a minimal hello world software.

Fast Models are supported on both Linux and Windows.
